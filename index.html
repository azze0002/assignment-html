        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            
            My name is Fairouz Azzeggah. I am a student at Algonquin College, currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Design <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I started this program on January 12 <sup>th</sup>. I chose this program because it is a new challenge for me, and I enjoy learning new skills every day. Studying IMD allows me to explore creative digital tools, improve my problem-solving abilities, and prepare for a career in interactive media. I am excited to grow both personally and professionally while discovering new opportunities in design and <em>technology</em>.

            In my free time, I enjoy cooking new recipes, playing football with my friends, and going shopping. These activities help me relax and have fun. I also like spending time with my family and learning new skills. Exploring hobbies makes my free time enjoyable and meaningful every day.
