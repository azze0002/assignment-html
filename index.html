            <p>
                My name is Fairouz Azzeggah. I am a student at Algonquin College, currently enrolled in the 
                Interactive Media Design <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. 
                I started this program on January 12 <sup>th</sup>. 
                I chose this program because it is a new challenge for me, and I enjoy learning new skills every day. 
                Studying IMD allows me to explore creative digital tools, improve my problem-solving abilities, 
                and prepare for a career in interactive media. I am excited to grow both personally and professionally 
                while discovering new opportunities in design and <em>technology</em>.
